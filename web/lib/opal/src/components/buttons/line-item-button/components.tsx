 * put every unrecognised prop somewhere that never renders it, so a label or a
 * handler was accepted and silently dropped. Now the leftover lands on the row
 * instead, and the compiler has the last word on the rest.
 *

 * cross-constraint `ContentProps` keeps between them. Every call site states
 * both explicitly, so what is given up is the compiler rejecting a pair that
